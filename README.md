# Reachability-state Encoding: Bridging tradeoffs between the Minimal Storage and the Fastest Query for Reachability Query

Welcome to the RE-toy algorithm and our reachability testing platform!

This repository includes the C++ implementation of the RE-toy algorithm, as described in our paper Reachability-state Encoding: Bridging tradeoffs between the Minimal Storage and the Fastest Query for Reachability Query. Additionally, it provides a platform that facilitates the validation and testing of reachability algorithms.

## Code Structure

The code is organized as follows:

- `Graph` class: represents the input graph. It can be constructed by random/complete Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) or conversion of input files representing directed graphs into DAGs. All algorithms within the platform utilize the `Graph` class as a unified input, enabling convenient and standardized testing.
- `AutoTest` class: provides functionality for testing reachability algorithms.
- `Timer` class: provides timing utilities.
- `Profile` struct: stores the results obtained from the testing process.
- `algorithms` directory: contains implementations of various reachability algorithms. To facilitate testing, we have made slight modifications to these algorithms, ensuring that they all inherit from the abstract class `Algorithm` and implement the same interface.
- `include` directory: contains library dependencies of some baseline algorithms.
- `graphs` directory: contains real DAGs used in our experiments.
- `main.cpp`: executes a single experiment, including the construction of index and query testing for of an algorithm with specific parameters on a given graph.
- `demo.sh` and `experiments.sh`: automate the execution of `main.cpp` to perform multiple tests.

## Usage

Here are the instructions for using the `reachability` program. Additionally, we have included a convenient script called `demo.sh` to facilitate the usage of this program. The `demo.sh` script serves as an example of automating multiple tests with various parameters using the `reachability` program. You can refer to the comments within the script to customize your own tests.

### Preparation

Compile the project and generate the `reachability` executable file.

### Parameters

To execute the program, use the following command:

```bash
./reachability [options]
```

#### Options

- `--help`: Show help message
- `--time <seconds>`: Set the maximum execution time in seconds for the program (required, unless --accuracy is specified)
- `--accuracy`: Run tests to validate the correctness of the algorithm (optional, --time parameter is not required)
- `--query_num <number>`: Set number of queries, default value is 100000 (optional)
- `--result_file <file>`: Set the file path for result output (optional, use when generating the result file)
- `--graph <type>`: Specify input graph type (required)
  - `--random <n> <d>`: Generate a random DAG with \<n\> nodes and \<d\> average degree
  - `--complete <n>`: Generate a complete DAG with \<n\> nodes
  - `--file <file_path>`: Load a directed graph from file and convert it to a DAG
- `--seed <seed>`: Set the seed for the generation of the random graph (optional)
- `--algorithm <algorithm_name> [algorithm_params]`: Specify the reachability algorithm to use and its parameters (required)

Here are the available reachability algorithms and their usages:

- `re_toy <x> <delta>`: RE-toy algorithm
- `bfl <K>`: BFL algorithm
- `grail <t> <ltype> <dim>`: GRAIL algorithm
- `pathtree <alg_type>`: PathTree algorithm
- `tol <style> <opr>`: TOL algorithm
- `ferrari <k> <seeds> <global>`: Ferrari algorithm
- `ip <k> <h> <mu>`: IP algorithm
- `pll <use_RQPrunedLandmarkLabeling>`: PLL algorithm
- `oreach`: O'Reach algorithm

#### Examples

Here are some examples of how to use the commands:

- Run the reachability algorithm RE-toy of specific parameters on a complete DAG with 1000 nodes with a maximum execution time of 100 seconds, and store the results in the specified path:

  ```bash
  ./reachability --time 100 --graph --complete 1000 --algorithm re_toy 32 2.0 --result_file ./result.csv
  ```

- Run tests to validate the correctness of the algorithm PLL on a randomly generated DAG with 100 nodes and an average degree of 3 with a specific seed without limiting the maximum execution time:

  ```bash
  ./reachability --accuracy --graph --random 100 3 --seed 29 --algorithm pll 1
  ```

Please note that the above examples are meant to illustrate the usage of command-line arguments, and you should replace specific parameter values and file paths with your own.

### Input Graph File Format

The input graph file should be in the `.txt` format and has `n` lines, representing a valid directed graph with `n` nodes, numbered from 0 to `n-1`. Each line of the file represents the neighbors of a node, with the lines ordered in ascending order. The format for each line is as follows:

```
[node]: [neighbor1] [neighbor2] ...
```

For example, a valid `graph.txt` file could look like:

```
0: 1 2
1: 2
2:
3: 1
4: 2 3
```

This file represents a graph with five nodes, where node 0 has edges to nodes 1 and 2, node 1 has an edge to node 2, and so on.

## Reproducing Our Experiments

The `experiments.sh` runs all the five experiments mentioned in the paper, namely parameter, tradeoff, real_graph, dense_up, and index_size.

To reproduce our experimental results, please begin by compiling the project and generating the `reachability` executable file. Once complete, you can execute the program using the following command:

```bash
./experiments.sh
```
